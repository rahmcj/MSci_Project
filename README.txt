README

Please work through the files, using a HPC if possible. Each presentation has the order you should run the bash scripts in.

If using the HPC, bash scripts should be submitted using "sbatch file_name.sh"

If not, you will need to run the following commands:

chmod +x file_name.sh

./file_name.sh

Bash scripts can be identified as they end in .sh

I would recommend working through the folders in the following order:

1. Panama
1a. Python_script
1b. R-script

2. Combined_data
2a. Python_script
2b. R-script


The classifier needs to be trained before you start assigning taxonomy. The scrips are in the Panama folder and the instructions are in the "Using Blue Crystal" presentation

Then follow the order in "Using the HPC" presentation
